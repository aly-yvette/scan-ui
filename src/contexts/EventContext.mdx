# EventContext


## Creating an EventContext
To allow better typing, you can create a new event context with a matching `<EventProvider>` and `useEventContext` hook. 
You should pass it a [discriminated union](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/type-system/discriminated-unions) of all 
events you plan to use in the system.
 
```typescript
// Specify your event types
// You can define these as any types you like, but ensuring you have a unique literal member such as "type" 
// is important
type Event = {type: "greeting", payload: string } | {type: "farewell", payload: string }

// Create and export
export const {EventProvider, useEventContext} = createEventContext<Event>();
```

You can now start to setup your event system.

## EventProvider

{/* @todo for some reason this won't generate code for generated components */}
{/* <Source of={EventContextStories.Default} /> */}

Wrap your components in `<EventProvider>`

```tsx
<EventProvider url="ws://localhost:8080">
    <Consumer>
</EventProvider>
```

## useEventContext hook
You can then use `useEventContext` in your components.

- `onMessage((event: Event) => void)`
- `send(event: Event)`
